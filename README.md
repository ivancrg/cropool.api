### Access and Firebase tokens

#### `/tokens`
GET. Expects `refresh_token` in request header. Short description:
* Checks whether the provided refresh JWT is valid using [`authenticateRefreshToken`](#authenticate-refresh-token):
    * If the token isn't valid: `token_management.js` middleware handles sending the response
    * If the token is valid: send response with HTTP 201 status, feedback string and header that includes access and Firebase tokens in header generated by `token_management.js`

### Account info

#### `/accountInfo`
GET. Expects `access_token` and `firebase_token` in request header. Short description:
* Checks whether the provided tokens are valid using [`authenticateAccessToken`](#authenticate-access-token) and [`authenticateFirebaseToken`](#authenticate-firebase-token):
    * If a token isn't valid: `token_management.js` middleware handles sending the response
    * If the tokens are valid: respond with user info in form of a JSON object consisting of user's first name, last name and profile picture URL


### Update info

#### `/updateInfo`
Patch. Expects `access_token` and `firebase_token` in request header. Expects both first and last name or profile picture URL (or all three values) in the request body. Short description:
* Checks whether the provided tokens are valid using [`authenticateAccessToken`](#authenticate-access-token) and [`authenticateFirebaseToken`](#authenticate-firebase-token):
    * If a token isn't valid: `token_management.js` middleware handles sending the response
    * If the tokens are valid: update provided values in cropool.api database, Firebase RTDB and Firebase AUTHDB


## Token management

### `token_management.js`
Used to store [JWT](https://jwt.io) utility functions.

### Generate access token

#### `generateAccessJWT(email)`
Generates access JWT that will belong to user with e-mail address `email` and will expire in 10 minutes.

### Generate refresh token

#### `generateRefreshJWT(email)`
Generates refresh JWT that will belong to user with e-mail address `email` and will expire in 7 days.

### Generate Firebase token

#### `generateFirebaseJWT(email, callback)`
Generates Firebase JWT that will belong to user with e-mail address `email` and will be used to authenticate with Firebase service.

### Register user and generate Firebase token

#### `registerUserGenerateFirebaseJWT(iduser, email, displayName, callback)`
Generates Firebase JWT that will belong to user with e-mail address `email` and will be used to authenticate with Firebase service. If the user wasn't registered to Firebase yet, a new user with an UID 'iduser' is created. His e-mail address is 'email' and his display name is 'displayName'. 

### Authenticate access token

#### `authenticateAccessToken(req, res, next)`
Expects an access JWT in request's `access_token` header (format "Bearer \<token\>"). Middleware used for authenticating access tokens with API endpoints that respond with user-specific sensitive information. Short description:
* Checks whether the token is null:
    * If the token is null: send response with HTTP 401 status
    * If the token isn't null: check whether the token is valid:
        * If the token isn't valid: send response with HTTP 403 status
        * If the token is valid: forward `user` identified in token with `next()`

### Authenticate refresh token

#### `authenticateRefreshToken(req, res, next)`
Expects a refresh JWT in request's `refresh_token` header (format "Bearer \<token\>"). Middleware used for authenticating refresh tokens with API endpoint that issues new access tokens [`/accessToken`](#access-token). Short description:
* Checks whether the token is null:
    * If the token is null: send response with HTTP 401 status
    * If the token isn't null: check whether the token is valid:
        * If the token isn't valid: send response with HTTP 403 status
        * If the token is valid: check whether the token was issued after user's creation timestamp and user's last logout timestamp:
            * If the token was created before any of the mentioned timestamps: send response with HTTP 403 status and feedback string
            * If the token was created after both of the mentioned timestamps:  forward `user` identified in token with `next()`

### Authenticate firebase token

#### `authenticateFirebaseToken(req, res, next)`
Expects a refresh JWT in request's `refresh_token` header (format "Bearer \<token\>"). Middleware used for authenticating refresh tokens with API endpoint that issues new access tokens [`/accessToken`](#access-token). Short description:
* Checks whether the token is null:
    * If the token is null: send response with HTTP 401 status
    * If the token isn't null: check whether the token is valid:
        * If the token isn't valid: send response with HTTP 403 status
        * If the token is valid: check whether the token was issued after user's creation timestamp and user's last logout timestamp:
            * If the token was created before any of the mentioned timestamps: send response with HTTP 403 status and feedback string
            * If the token was created after both of the mentioned timestamps:  forward `user` identified in token with `next()`


Expects an Firebase JWT in request's `firebase_token` header (format "Bearer \<token\>") and user's e-mail address in 'req.user.e_mail' field. Middleware used for authenticating access tokens with API endpoints that respond with/to Firebase user-specific sensitive information. Short description:
* Checks whether the token is null:
    * If the token is null: send response with HTTP 401 status
    * If the token isn't null: check whether the token is valid:
        * If the token isn't valid: send response with HTTP 403 status
        * If the token is valid: check whether the token's UID corresponds to previously authenticated 'user.e_mail' and whether the token was issued after user's creation timestamp and user's last logout timestamp:
            * If the token was created before any of the mentioned timestamps or UID and e-mail don't match: send response with HTTP 403 status and feedback string
            * If the token was created after both of the mentioned timestamps and UID and e-mail match: forward user's `uid` identified in token with `next()`
